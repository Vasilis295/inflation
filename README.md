Regression of cpi on profit margins and oil prices
Data from FRED for the US economy. As inflation is always and even more now a hot topic for economists, we investigate the relationship of profit margins and oil prices with inflation.
Results show a good fit fot the linear regression and this is in a way what we expected.
In next projects we will examine things even more deeply.
